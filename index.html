                Finolhu, Maldives</span>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                Renowned for its rich flora and fauna, this tropical isle, also known as the Three Coconut Isle, is
                situated amidst the coral reefs. A 15-minute speedboat ride from the airport brings you to the idyllic
                beach resort in Male surrounded by the azure waters of the Indian Ocean. Set delicately over the lagoon,
                this postcard-perfect getaway offers 64 sea-view suites and villas in Maldives that are luxurious and
                lavish; yet maintain a fine balance with nature. Our world-famous, award-winning presidential suite is,
                arguably, the most beautiful place on earth. At Taj Exotica Maldives, you are on Taj Time, where doing
                nothing is an art form. Time stands still—and yet there is never a dull moment. Within this oasis of
                calm set in paradise, lounge by the infinity pool or at your private beach, laze in a hammock over the
                blue waters and just lay below the stars at night. Go on a wildlife-spotting walk. Pure bliss. Savour
                the best from the culinary world with carefully selected ingredients sourced both locally and globally
                to please your palate.
